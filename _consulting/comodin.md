Worked together with the local energy utility [UTE](http://www.ute.com.uy) under sponsorship of the [IADB Bank](https://www.iadb.org/) on the implementation of a software and developing new algorithms to compute the optimal power flow problem in the distribution network. The software is now ready and being used in UTE.
