I'm an Applied Mathematician by trade, Electrical Engieneer by training and Computer Scientist as hobbyist. Currently I work as Associate Professor of Networks and researcher at Universidad ORT Uruguay, School of Engineering. I've got my PhD in Electrical Engineering from Universidad de la República (Uruguay) in 2011.

Most of my work consists on the application of mathematical models to manage congestion and resource allocation in complex networked systems, such as the Internet or Energy Networks. I specialize in Probability, Stochastic Processes and Queueing Theory, and I'm also a fan of Convex Optimization, Dynamic programming, Control Theory and Probability and Statistics in general.

I've been an Editor for IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking (2016-2020) and co-TPC Chair of Valuetools 20. I am categorized as Level II Researcher by the National Research System (SNI) and I am also part of PEDECIBA-Matemática.

During 2020-2021, I was drafted into the National Covid Response Task Force (GACH) together with many scientists, in the data analysis and modeling team. This was an awesome experience that really made a contribution in handling the pandemic in Uruguay, and I learned a lot from it.
