I'm an Applied Mathematician by trade, Electrical Engineer by training and Computer Scientist as hobbyist. Currently, I am Chair of the Networks and Communication Systems department at Universidad ORT Uruguay, School of Engineering. I've got my PhD in Electrical Engineering from Universidad de la República (Uruguay) in 2011.

Most of my research consists on the application of mathematical models to manage congestion and resource allocation in complex networked systems, such as the Internet or Energy Networks. My focus is on Probability, Stochastic Processes and Queueing Theory, and I'm also a fan of Convex Optimization, Dynamic programming, Control Theory and Probability and Statistics in general.

I've been an Editor for IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking (2016-2020) and co-TPC Chair of Valuetools'20. I am categorized as Level II Researcher by the National Research System (SNI) and I am also part of PEDECIBA-Matemática. Since 2021 I've been part of the Technical Area Committee for Engineering in the SNI.

During 2020-2021, I was drafted into the National Covid Response Task Force (GACH) together with many scientists, in the data analysis and modeling team. This was an awesome experience that really made a contribution in handling the pandemic in Uruguay, and I learned a lot from it.
