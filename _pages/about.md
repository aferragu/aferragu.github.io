I'm an Applied Mathematician by trade, Electrical Engieneer by training and Computer Scientist as hobbyist. Currently I work as Associate Professor of Networks and researcher at Universidad ORT Uruguay, School of Engineering. I've got my PhD in Electrical Engineering from Universidad de la Rep√∫blica (Uruguay) in 2011.

Most of my work consists on the application of mathematical models to manage congestion and resource allocation in complex networked systems, such as the Internet or Energy Networks. I specialize in Probability, Stochastic Processes and Queueing Theory, and I'm also a fan of Convex Optimization, Dynamic programming, Control Theory and Probability and Statistics in general.
