title: TU/e visit!
---

I was kindly invited by [Prof. S Borst](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/researchers/sem-borst) to visit [TU/e SPOR Cluster](https://spor.win.tue.nl/). It's been a great visit, and we held a very nice [SPOR Seminar](https://www.eurandom.tue.nl/eindhoven-spor-seminar/) together with [Prof. Benny Van Houdt](https://win.uantwerpen.be/~vanhoudt/) and [Prof. Christine Fricker](https://team.inria.fr/rap/members/fricker/). My slides are [[here]](/assets/pdf/eindhoven23_caching.pdf).
