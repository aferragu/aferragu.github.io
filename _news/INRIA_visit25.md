title: INRIA Paris visit
---

I am very grateful to have been invited by Professor [Francois Baccelli](https://www.inria.fr/en/francois-baccelli) to visit the [MATHNET Group](https://team.inria.fr/mathnet/) at [Centre INRIA Paris](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-paris-centre). It's nice to catch up with the colleagues and explore new research problems! I gave a seminar on [partial service queues with deadlines](/assets/pdf/partial_service_with_deadlines.pdf).
