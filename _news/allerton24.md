---

I was invited by [Bruce Hajek](https://hajek.ece.illinois.edu/) and [R. Srikant](https://sites.google.com/a/illinois.edu/srikant/) to present our [paper](/assets/pdf/allerton24.pdf) at the [60th Allerton Conference con Communications, Control and Computing](https://allerton.csl.illinois.edu/). It's always nice to visit UIUC and catch up with colleagues! [[slides]](/assets/pdf/allerton24_caching.pdf)
