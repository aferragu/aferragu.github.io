title: TU/e visit to EURANDOM.
---

I am very grateful to have been invited again by Prof. [Sem Borst](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/researchers/sem-borst) to visit the [EURANDOM](https://www.eurandom.tue.nl/) at Eindhoven. The [SPOR Seminar](https://www.eurandom.tue.nl/eindhoven-spor-seminar/) welcomed my [talk](/assets/pdf/geometric_bounds_2025.pdf) about load balancing, and I am very grateful.
