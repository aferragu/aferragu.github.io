Another talk on caching and pre-fetching and the crucial role of hazard rates I gave at the SPOR Seminar during my recent visit to Eindhoven. I'm very grateful to [Prof. Sem Borst](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/researchers/sem-borst) for inviting me. [[slides]](/assets/pdf/eindhoven23_caching.pdf)
