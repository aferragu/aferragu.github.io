In this course, we provide a basic introduction of numerical issues in computing. We describe floating point precision, analyze iterative algorithms to solve nonlinear equation problems, discuss least-squares and interpolation methods and give a brief introduction to ordinary differential equation numerical solving. The course is based on Julia.
